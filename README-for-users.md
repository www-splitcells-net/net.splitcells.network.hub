# Splitcells[™](https://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/3020232218735/DE) Network Hub

We establish an open source [ecosystem](https://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/index.html) centred around optimization and operations research.
We provide problem-solving functionality to users
from solving the [N-Queen puzzle](https://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/test/functionality/n-queen-problem.html) to
planning the [final high schools exams](https://live.splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/ui/editor/nocode/index.html).
Domain experts interact the [no-code editor](https://live.splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/ui/editor/nocode/index.html)
and developers use a concise [programming language](https://live.splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/ui/editor/code/index.html).
The software is available as an [accessible cloud platform](https://live.splitcells.net/) and
also runs locally as a [desktop program](https://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/network/distro/downloads/index.html).
The [shell project](https://splitcells.net/net/splitcells/shell/README.html) provides additional tooling
for the development and deployment of this software project.
